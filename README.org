* Usage
run following commands in different terminals
#+begin_src sh
  cargo run --bin server
  cargo run --bin client
  cargo run --bin client
  #...
#+end_src

* note (why bytes dependency)

+ The goal of Bytes is to provide a robust byte array structure for network programming.
+ The biggest feature it adds over Vec<u8> is shallow cloning.
+ In other words, calling clone() on a Bytes instance does not copy the underlying data.
+ Instead, a Bytes instance is a reference-counted handle to some underlying data.
The Bytes type is roughly an Arc<Vec<u8>> but with some added capabilities.
+ BytesMut <-> Arc<Mutex<Vec<u8>>>

* for learning purposes
This experience help me to get a deeper understanding about following knowledges:
+ tokio
+ async
+ io/net/tcp
+ bytes
+ Arc/Mutex/RwLock

The following skills are also get exercise:
+ generic
+ error handling
+ trait
+ mpsc
+ unittest
+ Vec/VecDeque/HashMap
